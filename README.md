# ACC-Server-Creation-Tool

My first use of tkinter GUI implementation in python. When hosting a server for the game Assetto Corsa Competizione, server settings are stored as JSON files. Editing these files requires knowledge of the values they accept and must be done through a text editor. This program solves this problem by using a GUI which only allows accepted values in each field, and then creates the JSON files for the user. A secondary goal of this program is to keep it inside a single .py file for easier distrobution to users.

Extra Features: Running the server application from within the GUI, saving and loading JSON file sets to make it easy to switch between mutliple sets of server settings

//TODO: Allowing the user to determine the allowed amount of thread / RAM for the server while it is running.
